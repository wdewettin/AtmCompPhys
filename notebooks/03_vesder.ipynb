Some more information about this event can be found [here](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/07/08/tijdslijn/) (in Dutch) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_European_floods) (in English). We have simulated this case in several different configurations. All the output data can be found in the 'data' folder: `/data/gent/courses/2025/computphys_C004504/input`. This data is stored in netCDF-files, which can be easily read as xarray Datasets (see introductory notebook on xarray). The naming convention of the netCDF-files is outlined below.

    "3. `<nhours>`: This refers to the number of hours that the simulation has run.\n",

Convert the units in the file (if necessary) to $\\text{mm}/\\text{h}$ by using the function `convert_to_mm_h`. You need to define the conversion factor `a`. Use the fact that water has a density of 1000 $\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^3$ in your calculations.\n",
    "- Lastly, in the attributes of the variable `pr`, you can find `cell_methods = time: mean`. This signifies that the variable does not represent an instantaneous value at a certain moment in time, but rather provides an average value over a certain time interval. The bounds of this time interval are given in the coordinate `time_bnds`. So, every value of the coordinate `time` has two corresponding values in the coordinate `time_bnds`: the start and end time of the interval over which the average is taken. Compare the values in `time_bnds` to those in `time`. For a `time` value at moment $x$, which interval corresponds to this? What is the advantage of providing the average precipitation flux, instead of the instantaneous value?\n",
