    "In this next part of the practical, we will investigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) in the simulations. We will do so by comparing the simulation to the MOCCA observational network. This network consists of 6 stations located in the city of Ghent. Each station is placed in a different urban environment, to gauge the influence of this environment on the micro-climate. One of these stations is located outside of the city, in Melle, and can be considered a rural station. We can define the UHI intensity by calculating the temperature difference between an urban and a rural station. This difference in temperature depends on the time of day. Therefore, the UHI is often studied by computing a so-called diurnal (or daily) cycle. This diurnal cycle is constructed by taking an average of the data over a certain period for each hour of the day. For example, all the data at midnight are averaged together, the data at 1:00, ... This diurnal cycle represents the variations throughout the day.\n",

Plot the difference between the urban and rural diurnal cycles. Is a urban heat island present in the simulations? What is the UHI intensity? At what hours of the day is it the highest?\n",

The simulation we discussed previously, `initSFX`, has been run with an initial surface state that was taken from a long-term climate simulation. This allows the soil variables to start from a state that was in equilibrium with the atmospheric variables. As these soil variables (such as temperature and moisture) are slowly-evolving, particularly the deep soil variables, the time to reach this equilibrium in a simulation can be of the order of months.\n",

This simulation is the `baseline`-simulation (also used in the practical about the Vesder case). For this simulation, the soil moisture and temperature variables are not yet in an equilibrium state and will hence first evolve towards this state. This will impact the atmospheric variables close to the surface. The process where a model moves towards an equilibrium state is called the spin-up period.\n",

The simulation with a cold start first has to relax to a state with a drier soil, while the other simulation does not. This process is paired with a larger latent heat flux (because of the excess evaporation) in the cold start-simulation. This inhibits the surface from heating up in this simulation and cause the surface temperature to be colder. This, in turn, leads to a colder near-surface air temperature. The air temperature is higher in the simulation with spin-up period, because of the higher sensible heat flux. "

    "The model which we have used for all simulations consists of an atmospheric part, ALARO, and a surface module, SURFEX. The interaction between the atmosphere and the surface is an important part of weather and climate modelling. These interactions depend heavily on the type of surface. SURFEX tackles this variety by considering four classes of surface: sea, (inland) water, town and nature. Based on an external dataset (ECOCLIMAP) every grid box of the model is assigned a certain fraction of each of these four classes. For example, for a model with a resolution of 4-km, we could find a grid box in a small town with 30 % town fraction and 70 % nature fraction. Also, a grid box containing a city by the coast could have a town fraction of 25 %, a nature fraction of 20 % and a sea fraction of 55 %. Note that the fractions for each grid box necessarily always sum to 100 %. Every part of the grid box is calculated separately by a different sub-module, specific to the surface type. The output of these calculations (for example the near-surface air temperature) are then aggregated for the whole grid box, by taking a weighted average, with the land use fractions taken as weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now investigate a simulation where we made some changes to the land use. For this simulation, we have taken every urban area and put it equal to rock. Normally, urban areas are calculated by the TEB (Town Energy Balance)-module, therefore we denote this simulation by `noTEB`. Explore this simulation by following the next steps:\n",
    "- Load in the `tas` (near-surface air temperature) data for the simulations `initSFX` (with towns) and `initSFXnoTEB` (without towns) for the simulation starting on 1 July 2019 (720 hours). Select the period of the heat wave: 22 until 26 July 2019. \n",
    "- Load in the `land_use` data for both simulations. Plot all fractions for both simulations and verify the differences are as expected.\n",
    "- Select only the data from points which have a town fraction higher than 20 % in the `initSFX`-simulations. Select these points for both simulations. In the `initSFXnoTEB`-simulation these points will have a 0 % town fraction.\n",
    "- Calculate the average diurnal cycle of the temperature averaged over all points for both simulations. The average diurnal (or daily) cycle is calculated by taking the average of a variable for each hour of the day. The `groupby`-function from xarray will prove useful for this part.\n",
    "- Compare the diurnal cycles for both simulations. What do you see? Plot the difference between both cycles. When is the difference largest?"
