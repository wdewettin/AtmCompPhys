    "In this next part of the practical, we will investigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) in the simulations. We will do so by comparing the simulation to the MOCCA observational network. This network consists of 6 stations located in the city of Ghent. Each station is placed in a different urban environment, to gauge the influence of this environment on the micro-climate. One of these stations is located outside of the city, in Melle, and can be considered a rural station. We can define the UHI intensity by calculating the temperature difference between an urban and a rural station. This difference in temperature depends on the time of day. Therefore, the UHI is often studied by computing a so-called diurnal (or daily) cycle. This diurnal cycle is constructed by taking an average of the data over a certain period for each hour of the day. For example, all the data at midnight are averaged together, the data at 1:00, ... This diurnal cycle represents the variations throughout the day.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important factor which influences the state of the atmosphere, and hence the weather, is its interaction with the surface. This interaction can be represented as the exchange of energy in the form of fluxes. We consider three types of energy exchange: radiation, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux. The variable names corresponding to these fluxes are respectively `rnetds`, `hfss` and `hfls`.\n",

    "- We will now determine the sign of these fluxes:\n",
    "    - The radiation flux `rnetds` is the net radiation flux: it is the difference between the incoming and outgoing radiation. The incoming radiation is primarily shortwave radiation: either direct (from the Sun) or diffuse (scattered solar radiation). The outgoing radiation is emmited by the surface itself; it is longwave radiation. The difference between these two contributions is the net radiation flux. When is this variable positive and negative? What does this mean: is a positive flux directed into or out of the surface?\n",
    "    - The sensible heat flux `hfss` is the heat transfer caused by the temperature difference between the surface and the atmosphere. The heat is transfered from the medium with the highest temperature to the medium with the lowest temperature. Compare the near-surface air temperature (`tas`) with the surface temperature (`ts`). Use this difference between `ts` and `ts` to derive the sign of the sensible heat flux.\n",
    "    - The latent heat flux is caused by the evaporation of soil moisture. This evaporation requires latent heat for the phase transition between the liquid and vapor phase. This heat is extracted from the soil, which causes it to cool. Consider the latent heat flux. In what direction is the postive latent heat flux defined? \n",
    "- Calculate the net energy flux into the surface by adding or subtracting (depending on how the direction is defined) the three flux contributions. Compare this with the surface temperature, stored in the variable `ts`."

    "In this practical, we have discussed the interaction between the surface and the atmosphere through fluxes. The simulation we discussed previously, `initSFX`, has been run with an initial surface state that was taken from a long-term climate simulation. This allows the soil variables to start from a state that was in equilibrium with the atmospheric variables. As these soil variables (such as temperature and moisture) are slowly-evolving, particularly the deep soil variables, the time to reach this equilibrium in a simulation can be of the order of months.\n",

This simulation is the `baseline`-simulation (also used in the practical about the Vesder case). For this simulation, the soil moisture and temperature variables are not yet in an equilibrium state and will hence first evolve towards this state. This will impact the atmospheric variables close to the surface. The process where a model moves towards an equilibrium state is called the spin-up period.\n",

There, a heat wave period is defined as a period when the maximum temperatures in Uccle reach at least 25 degrees for at least 5 consecutive days, with at least 30 degrees being reached on at least three days. Write an algorithm to automatically detect heatwaves based on daily maximum temperatures.

    "The model which we have used for all simulations consists of an atmospheric part, ALARO, and a surface module, SURFEX. The interaction between the atmosphere and the surface is an important part of weather and climate modelling. These interactions depend heavily on the type of surface. SURFEX tackles this variety by considering four classes of surface: sea, (inland) water, town and nature. Based on an external dataset (ECOCLIMAP) every grid box of the model is assigned a certain fraction of each of these four classes. For example, for a model with a resolution of 4-km, we could find a grid box in a small town with 30 % town fraction and 70 % nature fraction. Also, a grid box containing a city by the coast could have a town fraction of 25 %, a nature fraction of 20 % and a sea fraction of 55 %. Note that the fractions for each grid box necessarily always sum to 100 %. Every part of the grid box is calculated separately by a different sub-module, specific to the surface type. The output of these calculations (for example the near-surface air temperature) are then aggregated for the whole grid box, by taking a weighted average, with the land use fractions taken as weights. \n",
