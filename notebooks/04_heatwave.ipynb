One of these stations is located outside of the city, in Melle, and can be considered a rural station. We can define the UHI intensity by calculating the temperature difference between an urban and a rural station. This difference in temperature depends on the time of day. Therefore, the UHI is often studied by computing a so-called diurnal (or daily) cycle. This diurnal cycle is constructed by taking an average of the data over a certain period for each hour of the day. For example, all the data at midnight are averaged together, the data at 1:00, ...

The interaction between the atmosphere and the surface is an important part of weather and climate modelling. These interactions depend heavily on the type of surface. SURFEX tackles this variety by considering four classes of surface: sea, (inland) water, town and nature. Based on an external dataset (ECOCLIMAP) every grid box of the model is assigned a certain fraction of each of these four classes. For example, for a model with a resolution of 4-km, we could find a grid box in a small town with 30 % town fraction and 70 % nature fraction. Also, a grid box containing a city by the coast could have a town fraction of 25 %, a nature fraction of 20 % and a sea fraction of 55 %. Note that the fractions for each grid box necessarily always sum to 100 %. Every part of the grid box is calculated separately by a different sub-module, specific to the surface type.
