    "In this exercise we will take a look at the precipitation event from July 2021 which caused massive flooding in the Vesder basin. Some more information about this event can be found [here](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/07/08/tijdslijn/) (in Dutch) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_European_floods) (in English). We have simulated this case in several different configurations. All the output data can be found in the 'data' folder: `/data/gent/courses/2024/computphys_C004504/input`. This data is stored in netCDF-files, which can be easily read as xarray Datasets (see introductory notebook on xarray). Each of the netCDF-files has a structured name `<configuration>_<starttime>_<nhours>_<variable>_<tstart>_<tstop>_<tstep>_regridded.nc` where the different elements have the following meaning:\n",
    "1. `<configuration>`: This refers to the specific set-up of the model. For some experiments, we can change certain parameters in the model and investigate their impact. For this exercise, however, we will only use the data from the 'baseline' simulation.\n",
    "2. `<starttime>`: This refers to the start time of the simulation. By varying the start time, we can create an ensemble of different simulations of the same event (see below). The start time is written in the format of `<year><month><day><hour>`.\n",
    "3. `<nhours>`: This refers to the number of hours that the simulation has run.\n",
    "4. `<variable>`: This refers to the variable saved in this file. We use the standard abbreviations from the Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions. The ones you will mostly need in these exercises are:\n",
    "    - *pr*: Precipitation\n",
    "    - *tas*: Near-Surface Air Temperature\n",
    "5. `<tstart>`: This refers to the first time step of the data in the file. This is written in the format of `<year>-<month>-<day>T<hour>`.\n",
    "6. `<tstart>`: This refers to the last time step of the data in the file. This is written in the format of `<year>-<month>-<day>T<hour>`.\n",
    "7. `<tstep>`: This refers to the time between subsequent time steps in the data, expressed in seconds. You will see that this is 3600 s for all files (so all data have an hourly resolution).\n",
    "8. `regridded`: This refers to the fact that the data has been regridded from the orginal coordinate reference system (CRS) to a latitude-longitude reference system. This makes the data easier to work with.\n",
    "9. `.nc`: This extension denotes the fact that this is a netCDF-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by opening a file and loading in the data! Load in the precipitation data corresponding to the baseline simulation which started at midnight of 1 July 2021 and ran for 384 hours. You can use the xarray function `open_dataset` ([documentation](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_dataset.html)). Load in this dataset as the Python variable `ds` and inspect its contents by printing `ds` or simply running a cell which ends with `ds`. The following questions/tasks will help you along:\n",
    "- What are the dimensions of the data? Where can you find information about these dimensions?\n",
    "- First consider the spatial dimensions. What are the units? What is the resolution? Calculate the resolution in (kilo)metres. Use the fact that the radius of the Earth is 6371 km.\n",
    "- Next, consider the attributes of the variable `pr`. What are its units? Usually, precipitation flux is expressed in mm/h. Convert the units in the file (if necessary) to $\\text{mm}/\\text{h}$. Use the fact that water has a density of 1000 $\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^3$ in your calculations.\n",
    "- Lastly, in the attributes of the variable `pr`, you can find `cell_methods = time: mean`. This signifies that the variable does not represent an instantaneous value at a certain moment in time, but rather provides an average value over a certain time interval. The bounds of this time interval are given in the coordinate `time_bnds`. So, every value of the coordinate `time` has two corresponding values in the coordinate `time_bnds`: the start and end time of the interval over which the average is taken. Compare the values in `time_bnds` to those in `time`. For a `time` value at moment $x$, which interval corresponds to this? What is the advantage of providing the average precipitation flux, instead of the instantaneous value?"

    "- The units are degrees. The resolution is 0.07° for longitude and 0.045° for latitude. We can convert this to kilometres at a certain latitude $\\phi$, with $R$ the radius of the Earth:\n",
    "    - $\\Delta x = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta \\text{lon}}{360\\degree} \\right)$ * (circumference of circle of constant latitude) = $\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\text{lon}}{360\\degree}\\right) (2 \\pi R \\cos \\phi)$\n",

    "    So a precipitation flux expressed in $\\text{kg} / (\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s})$ needs to be multiplied by 3600 to convert it to $\\text{mm}/\\text{h}$.\n",
    "- The value at time $x$ corresponds to the average over the interval $[x - 1 h, x]$. Providing the hourly average precipitation flux enables us to exactly calculate the total amount of precipitation, which would not be possible if only the instantaneous flux were provided hourly."

There is a difference between summer and winter, because of daylight saving time (\"zomertijd\"). On the other hand, the time in the simulation is UTC (Universal Time Coordinated).
